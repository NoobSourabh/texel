        Imagine a world where parents are doing exactly what teachers do—actively participating in their child's education. This application helps bridge that gap.

        <b className="text-black/60"> Education is a shared responsibility between parents and institutions. </b> 
        Teachers involve children, but parents are usually kept in the dark and are generally uninformed about their child's school schedule.</p>

        <b className="text-black/60">Children spend nearly half their waking hours in school, while parents have very little experience.</b>
        This application gives parents empowering information. The homework section explains assignments clearly, covered topics, and needed support areas. This is about making parents active participants in the education of their child. Schools also greatly benefit from this. Our application monitors teacher and student engagement.
