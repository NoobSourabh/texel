                            At Texel, we believe that <b>education is the foundation of a bright future. </b>
                            We see ourselves as a company that empowers teachers, engages students,
                            and supports parents by offering tools that make administrative work easier and
                            improve learning experiences. We see a world where schools can focus again on the
                            <b> fun of teaching </b> and <b>learning without the heavy burden</b> of too much paperwork and
                            fragmented communication. Our ultimate goal is to develop an education ecosystem that
                            enables each user-being a teacher, student, or parent-to feel inspired, informed, and
                            empowered. We strive to deliver powerful tools and streamlined workflows to stimulate
                            environments that facilitate academic excellence in students, innovative and inspiring
                            activity among teachers, and engagement about children's education.
