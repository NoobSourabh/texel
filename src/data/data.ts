        in the market providing services at a discount but in return selling the important data and earning more profits from there.
        To ensure your safety Texel saves all your data in
        <strong>&nbsp;encrypted format rather than raw </strong>
        assuring that there will be
        <strong>&nbsp; no breach of data.</strong>`,
